# How to use python on pc

## This tutorial is for peoples who never ever used python and are stuck at litterally the download part
## Its suppose to help someone into the first steps

Python can be either a scripting or a programming language which in programming aspects can be either a Procedural programming language or an Object oriented, but that will be explained in the [Precised description]()./
assuming you have no knowledge about programming, Python is the perfect language to look at for you./
Starting from the beginning, you first have to download or find a compiler./
/
### My recommandations from top to bottom
#### Downloadable

1. [Idle](https://www.python.org/)\
On my option the best since its simple and is very connected to windows.
Uses CMD directly for PIP installs and very fast and practical compiler
2. [Visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/)\
the second best since so many peoples use it, personnaly i think it has too much
But its all a question of taste
3. [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)\
Has a normal compiler interface, nothing so much special about it
4. [Tygerjython](https://tigerjython.ch/de)\
Very fast compiler, simple as well, but module limited

there are soo many more compilers

#### Web based

1. [Python compiler](https://www.online-python.com/online_python_compiler)
Nothing special, just a fast and normal python compiler
2. [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/retro/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb)
Has all the python modules ever already preinstalled
can be well used for AI's since its one of the only supporting Torch
3. [OnlineGB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler)
Has some bonuses in knowledge, gives a small base to learn from.


## After download.

each Compiler must be started differently.
so lets start.

##### 1. Idle
idle can be started using the window search bar on the bottom left when you search "Idle".\
An idle window will pop up, which is not yet the place where the code has to be saved\
\
By either pressing "Ctrl + N" or clicking the "File" on the top left then "New File", you start your journey\
This IDE has 2 interfaces normaly, one Console application and one Compiler application.\
you want to use the compiler since you can save big codes there simply by "Ctrl + S" or clicking "File" and "Save".\
\
what i like personnaly about it **"can vary troughout peoples"**.\
is that **theres nothing else getting in your way, you can focus entirely of your code**.\
\
Now, idle might not look so good to you, maybe try openning the **"options"** then click **"Configure idle"**.\
i always like to put the **font size to 20** "Predefined its 10" and also once you set the font size go to "Hightlights" and\ click the button "Idle classic" to put **"Idle dark"**.\
\
Enjoy your idle :b

##### 2. Visual studio
Visual studio is made for almost every language out there.\
Visual studio also has some more file supported swapping, which can either be a curse or a blessing.\
There is one thing i specificly dont like about Visual studio, is that its such a heavy programm.\
But visual studio is certainly worth a try\
\
Visual studio is oppened on searching "Visual studio" on your searchbar.\
but it also has a widget on your desktop, you can drag and drop any file into that widget and it opens them, even whole folders, so first you have to create a new "fileName.py" and drag it on the widget.\
\
executing any file is as easy as "F5".\
\
Python specificly needs an installed python IDE on visual studio, so if you don't have it, you can simply execute the code and it will bring you directly to the install page.\
\
Enjoy your Visual studio :b\
_My opinion is that its overated_

##### 3. pycharm
Pycharm is a small and simple compiler that supports a wide variety of python versions and even modules.\
Pycharm supports Framework such a Django well.\
\
In pycharm you can simply open it over your searchbar searching "pycharm".\
Pycharm scripts are executed trought a simple green arrow pointing to the right "â–·".\
\
Pycharm is simple to use and doesn't require much space.\
\
Enjoy your pycharm :b

##### 4. TigerJython
Tygerjython was developped to be a small java program.\
It is at the same time a python compiler with the just basics of python.\
modules cannot be imported, but the runtime of the compiler is fast as a bolt.\
Tygerjython can be used to calculate huge calculations very quickly and with a simple syntax.\
Tho i whouldn't recommand anyone to work with it, its simple interface and quick speeds fits perfectly a newcommer.\
\
Tygerjython creates simple .py files and can also open an existing by clicking "file" and then "open".\
Creating a new file is as simple as just starting to write and save it somewhere where you want.\
\
I Strongly recommand it to you if you start programming and have no experience with codes.\
\
Enjoy your Tygerjython :b
