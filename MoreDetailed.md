# Scripting, programming ? Procedural and Object oriented?

## If youre new to it, it shouldn't be a topic you should look at, at the momment at least

## Now to you more advanced python programmer, i will explain you what Those themes are

#### Scripting VS Programming languages 
Primarly python is a scripting language which does not create any EXE file.\
Python is executed primarly from a .PY file and thus makes python a scripting programming language,\
Python does not need to make a EXE file that it executes once the code is Ran.\
Thats what makes pythons runtime faster than others that have to recreate a .exe file everytime\
C# for example creates a exe file in the BIN.\
Python can also be converted into a EXE file which gives it also a programming language part.\
\
in python you can transform a .py to a .exe using "auto-py-to-exe"\
try:
```
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```

then once its downloaded 
simply try 
```
auto-py-to-exe
```

it opens a website you can change a .py file to an .exe\

#### Procedural and Objectoriented
##### Procedural

Procedural programming is when the code passes from Top to Bottom.
There can be functions and all but it does not have classes.
A procedural hello world looks like this

```
print("Hello world")
```

##### Objectoriented

Object oriented has to do with classes that contain multiples values that are only specificly belonging to those classes
Classes do hold each a big part of code
And were ment to cut ennormous programs into pieces
a Objectoriented hello world looks like this
```
class sayHi():
    def __init__(objectItself):
        print("Hello world")
        
saySomething = sayHi()
```
